      <ol>
        <li>Good Affordance Example</li>
        <a href="http://www.mediamonks.com">Mediamonks.com</a>
        <p>One of the coolest websites I came across. The affordance is really nice on this page
        the lines are clean and you know exactly what you're clicking on and where the link will take you.
        It has nice hover effects on almost every element in a way that adds to the design but isn't distracting.</p>
        <li>Good Chunking Example</li>
        <a href="http://heavyheavy.com">Heavyheavy.com</a>
        <p>This site is simple and clean and chunks the information in a way that is easy to understand and navigate.
          The user has 6 choices to choose from which makes it a good exampe of hick's law as well. The information is
          chunked in a logical order that is easy to use and understand.</p>
        <li>Good Modularity Example</li>
        <a href="http://opnbx.com">opnbx.com</a>
        <p>This website does a really good job at showing modularity. The clean design makes it easy
        to understand whats going on but everything is broken up into seperate sections that the user
        can interact with. The website scrolls left to right giving different information on different topics after
        a topic is chosen the user can scroll down and see different information presented in pictures and text that
        can be expanded and viewed more closely.</p>
        <li>Good Signal to Noise Ratio</li>
        <a href="http://union.co">Union.co</a>
        <p>This website is a great example of good signal to noise ratio in the sense that there
          is very little noise. The website is clean and ads don't distract you from the content and purpose
          presented in the website. The interactivity is also really cool when implemented in the design and the colors are simple.</p>
        <li>Good Ockham's Razor Example</li>
        <a href="http://andy-shield.co.uk">Andy Shield Portfolio</a>
        <p>Simplicity is best. This website has clean lines, minimal choices to choose from and gets
          right to the point. The designer has a short, concise "about me" section followed by a short article
          and some of his work. The page is minimalistic in nature and has a place to contact him. The design is really nice
          and simple and presents the necessary information in a way that isn't overwhelming and gets right to the point.</p>
      </ol>
    <h2>Things that don't</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Bad Affordance Example</li>
        <a href="http://www.biologyjunction.com">Biology Junction</a>
        <p>With this website there are a lot of distracting elements going on. There are multiple clickable links
          all labeled under different sections that the user doesn't really know where to go or how to find what they are looking for.
          On top of that the moving gif's and ad placement is distracting and the page layout is hard to work with. </p>
        <li>Bad Chunking Example</li>
        <a href="http://careers.bmj.com/careers/hospital-medical-healthcare-doctors-jobs.html">BMJ Health Blog</a>
        <p>The link that lead me to this website said their page was "new and improved" which makes me wonder
          what their old website looked like. The website is pretty text heavy and there isn't really a way
          to differentiate between the sections. Essentially everything is a clickable link it makes the user
          not want to stick around to try to find their way around the page.<p>
        <li>Bad Modualrity Example</li>
        <a href="http://donswansonracingschool.com/programs.htm">Don Swanson Racing School</a>
        <p>This one is bad for a lot of reasons. The dark background, lack of color scheme and overly vibrant flashy colors
        make the website distracting. That coupled with the small font, poor design, and zero modularity make the page
        run on and on with no break between the sections. Instead of using elements to distribute information in a modular
        fashion throughout the page, the creator simply just changed the color and added line breaks in-between the text sections.</p>
        <li>Bad Rule of Thirds Example</li>
        <a href="http://www.gorwood.com">Gorwood.com</a>
        <p>This one is bad for a lot of reasons it's essentially just in image with a few links thrown over the top.
        There are essentially no design elements and the rule of thirds and pretty much every other
        aspect of good design is nonexistent. Clicking on the links makes things worse when you are brought
        to other pages with no sense of modularity, chunking, or affordance.</p>
        <li>Bad Hick's Law Example</li>
        <a href="http://www.coolmath.com">Cool Math</a>
        <p>Hick's law deals with decisions and this website, unfortunately, has many to choose from. Pretty much every icon is a button
          that links to something else. It makes it difficult to choose what you want to click on with everything being so close together,
          so colorful, and having a million different options to choose from.</p>
